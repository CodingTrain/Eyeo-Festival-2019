    <td>Description</td>
    <td>No slides. No script. In this talk, Dan will attempt to live code an interactive simulation using a variety of creative coding tools including p5.js, ml5.js, and Runway. The simulation will be trained to respond to audience interaction using a machine learning technique known as “transfer learning.” If everything breaks, he’ll have his book of Random Numbers with him for a dramatic reading. <br><br>
Daniel Shiffman: #CREATIVE CODING  <br>
#PROCESSING  <br>
#P5.JS <br><br>
Dan is on a mission to share code with the world. (In a fun, approachable way.) On his hugely popular youtube channel, The Coding Train, he publishes “creative coding” video tutorials every week. Subjects covered range from the basics of programming languages like JavaScript (with p5.js) and Java (with Processing) to generative algorithms like physics simulation, computer vision, and data visualization.</td>
