# Eyeo Festival 2019

This repository documents the Coding Train live demonstration at the [Eyeo Festival 2019](http://eyeofestival.com/). The demonstration occurred on Tuesday, June 4th 3:30pm in the Cinema at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

![The Unicorn Race is an interactive game built with p5.js in which the audience racesüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è characters across the screen based on what the computer ‚Äúsees üëÄ‚Äù and ‚Äúhears üëÇ‚Äù. The game uses ml5.js to use machine learning models trained in Google‚Äôs Teachable Machine and tensorflow.js to allow the game to recognize custom objects üëú  and sounds üîä. Crossing the finish line rewards the audience with an AI generated rainbow image üåà - RainbowGAN - made with RunwayML. The RainbowGAN image is then broadcast to the world üåç on social media using a node.js/express.js server running twit.js.](summary.png)
